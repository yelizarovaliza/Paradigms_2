# Paradigms_2

## 1. What is object-oriented paradigm?
Object-oriented paradigm is a programming model that focuses on treating data rather than logic and actions. Object-Oriented Software Design revolves around objects as opposed to procedures or function calls, with the objects being instances of classes. These objects communicate by passing messages to one another which triggers method execution. The four main principles behind this approach are encapsulation, inheritance, polymorphism and abstraction.

## 2. What is a class?
A class defines a blueprint or template from which objects can be created. It specifies what attributes (fields) and methods will be available in any object made from it. In other words, a class encapsulates both the data structure for an object as well as the procedures used to manipulate this data structure. Essentially, a class acts like a user-defined type.

## 4. What is the difference between fields and methods?
- Fields: Fields, also known as attributes or properties, are variables that hold the state of an object. They represent the data or characteristics of an object.
- Methods: Methods are functions defined within a class that describe the behaviors or actions that an object can perform. Methods can manipulate the fields of the object and perform operations.

## 5. Enumerate key object-oriented principles.
Encapsulation: The bundling of data (fields) and methods that operate on that data within a single unit, or class, and restricting access to some of the object's components.
Abstraction: The process of hiding the complex implementation details and showing only the essential features of the object.
Inheritance: The mechanism by which one class can inherit fields and methods from another class, promoting code reuse and establishing a natural hierarchy.
Polymorphism: The ability of different classes to be treated as instances of the same class through a common interface, typically via method overriding or method overloading.

## 6. Explain benefits of using object-oriented paradigm comparing to procedural and structural.
Modularity: Object-oriented programming (OOP) promotes modularity through classes and objects, making it easier to manage and maintain large codebases compared to procedural programming.
Reusability: OOP encourages the reuse of code through inheritance and polymorphism, reducing redundancy and improving efficiency.
Scalability: OOP designs are more scalable as they allow for the easy addition of new features through the extension of existing classes.
Maintainability: The encapsulation principle in OOP helps in isolating changes to a specific part of the program, making it easier to update and maintain.
Flexibility: Polymorphism provides flexibility by allowing different objects to be treated the same way, simplifying the code and enhancing functionality.
Real-world modeling: OOP closely mirrors real-world entities, making it intuitive and easier to design complex systems.

## 7. Describe the program translation process from the source code to the final executable.
Writing Source Code: Programmers write source code in a high-level programming language.
Compilation: The compiler translates the high-level source code into machine code or an intermediate code. This involves several stages:
Lexical Analysis: Tokenizing the source code.
Syntax Analysis: Parsing tokens to ensure correct syntax.
Semantic Analysis: Checking for semantic errors and creating an intermediate representation (IR).
Optimization: Improving the IR for performance.
Code Generation: Generating machine code from the optimized IR.
Linking: The linker combines the machine code with any necessary libraries or modules to produce a single executable file. This includes resolving symbols and addresses.
Loading and Execution: The operating system loads the executable into memory and begins execution.

## 8. What is compiler responsible for?
A compiler is responsible for translating high-level source code written in a programming language into machine code or an intermediate code. This includes:

    Performing lexical, syntax, and semantic analysis.
    Optimizing the intermediate code.
    Generating target machine code.
    Reporting errors and warnings in the source code.

## 9. What is a linker?
A linker is a tool that combines multiple object files generated by the compiler, along with any required libraries, into a single executable file. The linker resolves symbol references, addresses, and ensures that all code and data are correctly placed in memory. It can also handle tasks such as library management and relocation.
